# gochimp

A Go library for interacting with the [Mailchimp API](http://kb.mailchimp.com/api).

Includes support for [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs).

**Note:** _This is very much a work in progress! Currently only the features needed immediately by Ussie are implemented.
Anything may change in the future. Use at your own risk!_

Contributions, criticism and suggestions welcome.

Will also do our best to add features upon request. The goal is to evolve this into a full-fledged client.
